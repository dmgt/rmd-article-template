  abstract = {Moving air has long been used to provide comfort in warm environments. Provision for indoor air movement was one of the wellsprings of traditional architectural design in warm regions, affecting building form, components, and equipment over millennia. However, this design option has faded from practice since the advent of air-conditioning, in which the focus has been on controlling temperature and humidity. Despite the fact that air movement can be an energy efficient alternative to air cooling, it became viewed more as a possible source of undesirable draft, and comfort standards came to set room airspeed limits very low, even for temperatures as warm as 26\textordmasculine{}C (79\textordmasculine{}F). An exception was granted if the airspeed source was under personal individual control, such as a window in a private office, or a desk fan, but only above 26 \textordmasculine{}C (79\textordmasculine{}F).},

  abstract = {To determine the effectiveness of ceiling fans in enhancing comfort, 256 subjects were examined at 24.4 C (76 F), 26.1 C (79 F), 27.8 C (82 F), and 29.4 C (85 F) (all at 50\% rh), in an environmental chamber that was equipped with a ceiling fan that produced four velocity conditions: 0.15 m/s (30 fpm), 0.25 m/s (50 fpm), 0.46 m/s (90 fpm), and 1.02 m/s (200 fpm). A fifth velocity, in which the fan was not employed, was 0.06 m/s (10 fpm); this served as the control velocity. Three subjective responses were measured: thermal sensation (a 9-category rating scale), thermal comfort (a 7-pair semantic differential scale), and a question on temperature preference. The results showed that an air plume from a ceiling fan whose velocity is between 0.5 and 1.0 m/s (90 and 200 fpm) compensates for a 2.8\textendash{}3.3$^\circ$C (5\textendash{}6$^\circ$F) temperature change; this represents an energy savings of 15\textendash{}18\% when based on the National Bureau of Standards' suggestion of a reduction in air conditioning energy demand of 6\% per $^\circ$C or 3\% per $^\circ$F. It also concluded that a ceiling fan may extend the upper limit of the summer comfort envelope from 26.1 to 29.4 C (79 to 85 F) and that the turbulent and variable characteristics of the air plume of the ceiling fan may be its major comfort-producing attribute.},

  abstract = {As the main regulation tool of indoor thermal environment in warm seasons, air-conditioners are used to keep a cool environment. However, this causes problems of huge energy consumption and poor indoor air quality. In contrast, electric fans promise an indoor cooling effect with lower energy consumption. This makes the exploration of air flow utilization significative. This paper discusses the results of a research with both an online survey and a series of climate chamber experiment to study user requirements for air movement in their daily life. The online survey results showed that electric fans were widely accepted in both homes and offices because they were environmental friendly, low-cost and could provide a fresh feeling. The results of climate chamber experiment identified suitable range of indoor temperature to use electric fans and their corresponding range of air speeds. The air flow generated by electric fans could be used as an effective cooling method to maintain a comfortable environment at 28~$^\circ$C\textendash{}32~$^\circ$C. Compared with the acceptable range of temperature and air speeds for the comfort zone recommended by the ASHRAE Standard 55-2010, this study showed that air speeds over 0.8~m/s were acceptable and they could offset a higher temperature. With reasonable utilization, electric fans could provide a healthy and energy-efficient way to control indoor environment.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a spectrum of systems that cool or heat occupants personally, termed `personal comfort systems' (PCS), in order to quantify their ability to produce comfort in ambient temperatures that are above or below the subjects' neutral temperatures. The comfort-producing effectiveness may be quantified in terms of a temperature difference, coining the index `corrective power' (CP). CP is defined as difference between two ambient temperatures at which equal thermal sensation is achieved - one with no PCS (the reference condition), and one with PCS in use. CP represents the degree to which a PCS system may ``correct'' the ambient temperature toward neutrality. CP can alternatively be expressed in terms of thermal sensation and comfort survey scale units. Published studies of PCS are reviewed to extract their CP values. Cooling CP ranges from~-1 to~-6~K, and heating CP from 2K to 10~K. The physical characteristics of the particular PCS systems are not reported in detail here, but are presented as prototypes of what is possible. Deeper understanding of PCS will require new physiological and psychological information about comfort in local body segments and subsegments, and about spatial and temporal alliesthesia. These topics present many opportunities for productive future research.},

  abstract = {In a warm and humid climate, increasing the temperature set point offers considerable energy benefits with low first costs. Elevated air movement generated by a personally controlled fan can compensate for the negative effects caused by an increased temperature set point. Fifty-six tropically acclimatized persons in common Singaporean office attire (0.7 clo) were exposed for 90~minutes to each of five conditions: 23, 26, and 29$^\circ$C and in the latter two cases with and without occupant-controlled air movement. Relative humidity was maintained at 60\%. We tested thermal comfort, perceived air quality, sick building syndrome symptoms, and cognitive performance. We found that thermal comfort, perceived air quality, and sick building syndrome symptoms are equal or better at 26$^\circ$C and 29$^\circ$C than at the common set point of 23$^\circ$C if a personally controlled fan is available for use. The best cognitive performance (as indicated by task speed) was obtained at 26$^\circ$C; at 29$^\circ$C, the availability of an occupant-controlled fan partially mitigated the negative effect of the elevated temperature. The typical Singaporean indoor air temperature set point of 23$^\circ$C yielded the lowest cognitive performance. An elevated set point in air-conditioned buildings augmented with personally controlled fans might yield benefits for reduced energy use and improved indoor environmental quality in tropical climates.},

  abstract = {The effects of air movement from ceiling fans on subjective thermal comfort and perceived air quality (PAQ) were examined for warm-humid environments. In a climate chamber controlled at three temperatures (26~$^\circ$C, 28~$^\circ$C and 30~$^\circ$C) and two relative humidity (RH 60\% and 80\%), sixteen subjects (8 males and 8 females) dressed in summer clothing (0.5 clo) were exposed to 7 levels of air speed ranging from 0.05~m/s to 1.8~m/s. The subjects were asked to rate their thermal sensation, comfort, PAQ, air movement acceptability, humidity sensation, eye-dryness during the 2-h~and 15~min long tests. Air movement significantly improves the subjects' thermal comfort, PAQ, and humidity sensation without causing dry-eye discomfort. Without air movement, the 80\% acceptable limit established by the ASHRAE standard 55 was reached at 26$^\circ$C/60\%RH, 26$^\circ$C/80\%RH, and 28$^\circ$C/60\%RH. With air movement, more than 80\% of the subjects perceived the environments acceptable at 28$^\circ$C/80\%RH, 30$^\circ$C/60\%RH, and 30$^\circ$C/80\%RH. The preferred air speeds for ceiling fans were in many cases higher than the limit specified in ASHRAE Standard, which is 0.8~m/s when users have no control over the fan.},

  abstract = {Here we present a field study examining the impact of elevated room temperature and air movement on thermal comfort and self-reported productivity. This experiment was performed in three environmental conditions (one with a set-point of 23 $^\circ$C\textemdash{}a typical set-point used in Singapore\textemdash{}and two elevated (up to 28 $^\circ$C) room temperature conditions). Occupants had shared control of ceiling fans. The results show that the most comfortable thermal condition, with thermal sensation closest to neutral, is achieved at a room temperature of 26 $^\circ$C with operating fans. Increasing the temperature set-point from 23 $^\circ$C to 26 $^\circ$C resulted in a significant increase in thermal acceptability (from 59\% to 91\%), and a 44 kWh/m2yr savings in electrical energy used for comfort cooling. We found that a room's set-point temperature can be increased up to 27 $^\circ$C without creating a negative impact when controllable air movement is provided compared to an environment with a set-point of 23 $^\circ$C. Thermal satisfaction is significantly higher in spaces of 26 $^\circ$C with operating fans, than when the room's temperature is set at the typical 23 $^\circ$C. Moreover, the relative humidity in the office is decreased from 62\% (when the temperature was 23 $^\circ$C) to 50\% when the temperature was 27 $^\circ$C. Occupant's self-reported ability to concentrate, be alert, and ability to be productive was comparably high in all conditions. The results indicate that work performance is poorly correlated with room temperature, but increases with greater individual thermal satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Personal Comfort Systems (PCS) provide individual occupants local heating and cooling to meet their comfort needs without affecting others in the same space. It saves energy by relaxing ambient temperature requirements for the HVAC system. Aside from these benefits, PCS offers a wealth of data that can describe how individuals interact with heating/cooling devices in their own environment. Recently developed Internet-connected PCS chairs have unlocked this opportunity by generating continuous streams of heating and cooling usage data, along with occupancy status and environmental measurements via embedded sensors. The data allow individuals' comfort and behavior to be learned, and can inform centralized systems to provide `just the right' amount of conditioning to meet occupant needs. In summer 2016, we carried out a study with PCS chairs involving 37 occupants in an office building in California. During the study period, we collected $>$5 million chair usage data-points and 4500 occupant survey responses, as well as continuous measurements of environmental and HVAC system conditions. The data analysis shows that (1) local temperatures experienced by individual occupants vary quite widely across different parts of the building, even within the same thermal zone; (2) occupants often have different thermal preferences even under the same thermal conditions; (3) PCS control behavior can dynamically describe individuals' thermal preferences; (4) PCS chairs produce much higher comfort satisfaction (96\%) than typically achieved in buildings. We conclude that PCS not only provide personalized comfort solutions but also offer individualized feedback that can improve comfort analytics and control decisions in buildings.},
