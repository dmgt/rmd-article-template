# Introduction
## Benefits of air movement in buildings
Here is an example of an introductory paragraph with citations. The following paragraph is from @rafteryDataCeilingFans :

>Having the ability to increase the air speed in a room in a controlled manner provides many advantages. It increases the heat transfer from occupants to the environment by convection and evaporation, allowing them to remain comfortable in warmer conditions [@tanabeEstimationThermalSensation1993; @tanabeEffectsAirTemperature1994a; @arensMovingAirComfort2009]. Many laboratory studies show that air movement provides comfort in warmer conditions [@rohlesEnhancingThermalComfort1982; @huangStudyDemandAir2013; @zhangReviewCorrectivePower2015a; @schiavonThermalComfortPerceived2017] even at 30°C and 80% RH @zhaiHumanComfortPerceived2015a and this is accepted in existing thermal comfort standards (e.g. @ashraeASHRAEStandard552017). A field study intervention adding ceiling fans to an air-conditioned office found that occupants were equally or more comfortable at 26-27°C with increased air movement than at 23°C without @lipczynskaThermalComfortSelfreported2018. Giving occupants control over air movement provides an instantaneous way to respond to changing thermal comfort needs, responding faster than possible with Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment designed to condition the whole room @kimOccupantComfortBehavior2019a.


## Terminology
Here is an example of a short terminology section, with terms quoted from @rafteryDataCeilingFans. 

-   Fan rotational speed (*N*): Physical fan rotational speed (rpm).
-   Fan airflow (*Q*): Volumetric airflow rate through the fan blades (m³/s).
-   Blade height (*H*): Distance from floor to blade, measured at hub (m).

## Objective
This paper's primary goals are: (1) goal one; and (2) goal two

# Methods
## Example data
The data in this template are is `iris` dataset freely avalible at the [University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris),  originally published by R.A. Fischer in 1936. The dataset and its variables are described in the included `iris-names` file under `SupplementaryMaterial/Data` ). The `iris` dataset is also avalible by default when you load R, but in this case we're reading it in as a csv file to simulate working with external data. 

## Another subtitle
Here is an example of including a figure (which is included at the end of the paper) Figure \@ref(fig:experimentimage) is a saved .png image. It appears that SVG images aren't recognized when markdown file is converted to PDF. 

Here is a footnote [^footnote1].

[^footnote1]:Example footnote.

```{r experimentimage, message=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "R logo, from https://www.r-project.org/logo/, used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license (CC-BY-SA 4.0)"}
# Figure is included after article text
include_graphics(here("Paper","SupplementaryMaterial","Figures","RLogo.png"))
```

## Another subtitle
Here is another footnote and an example of programatically calculating a number to be reported in the text[^footnote2]. In the next sentance, the number of iris classes is calculated from a short piece of code, and the result is included as a variable, so that you don't need to manually update the number in the text if more data is added or the analysis changes. Figure \@ref(fig:irises) shows each of the `r length(unique(df$iris_class))` iris classes in this experiment. The number for the figure refence in the previous sentence is also being automatically generated based on its order in the paper.

[^footnote2]:Another footnote.

```{r irises, message=FALSE, fig.width =8, fig.height = 4.5, fig.cap = "Petal and sepal lengths from iris dataset" }

ggplot(df, aes(x = petal_length, y = sepal_length, group = iris_class)) + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", color = "darkgray") +
  geom_point(aes(color = iris_class, shape = long_sepal), alpha = 1, size=2) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,8), ylim = c(0,8)) + 
  stat_poly_eq(formula = y~x, 
               aes(color=iris_class, label = paste(..eq.label.., sep = "~~~")), 
               parse = TRUE, label.y = c(2, 2.5, 3), 
               label.x = 7, hjust = 1, size = 3.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0),expression(Petal~length ~ (cm))) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0),expression(Sepal~length (cm))) +
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Class",
                            reverse=T, override.aes = list(shape = 15, size=3)), 
         shape=guide_legend(title="long_sepal")) +
  scale_color_manual (values = cal_palette4)
```


## Reproducible research
We wrote this paper using R Markdown. All of the text, references, bibliography, data analysis and visualization occurs in one file (Manuscript.Rmd), which automatically builds the document that we submitted to the editor. The supplementary material contains the .Rmd file as well as the entire measurement dataset.

# Results

## Subtitle
``` {r versicolor, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
versicolor = df%>%filter(iris_class == "Iris-versicolor")

```
Here is another example of using variables in the text that are directly calculated from the underlying data. The median, lower and upper quartiles of the *versicolor* petal lengths are `r versicolor%>%summarize(median(petal_length))`, `r versicolor%>%summarize(quantile(petal_length,.25))`, and `r versicolor%>%summarize(quantile(petal_length,.75))` cm respectively. 

## Example of a violin plot
Figure \@ref(fig:petalwidths) shows petal widths by iris type.

``` {r petalwidths, message=FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Petal widths by class" }

df %>%
    ggplot() + 
    geom_violin(aes( x = iris_class, y = petal_width, color = iris_class), draw_quantiles = T, trim = F, show.legend = F) +
    geom_boxplot(aes( x = iris_class, y = petal_width, color = iris_class), width = 0.07, show.legend = F)+
    ggtitle("Petal widths by unit") +
    scale_color_manual(values=cal_palette4) 
    
```
 
### Math example
 Here is an example of an equation written using LATEX. The constants are made up for this example : 
$$AB_{avg} = 1 * \frac{\sqrt c}{D} - 0.23\ * \frac{E}{F}  = 45$$
Here is another equation:

$$ CD_{rated} = \frac{4*Q}{\pi*D^2} = 1.91~m/s$$

## Limitations
It is important to include a discussion of limitations in any paper. Limitations of this template include:

- Figures are included after the txt, not at the location where they are discussed in the text
- No example of a table yet
